Ralias
======
This is a simplistic R package that makes the use of R even more
straightforward by providing utility functions and aliases for
usual tasks and commands. Feel free to take and contribute!


You can simply download the package and install it the regular way:

R> install.packages('ralias_XYZ.tar.gz')

To compile the package(documentation/pdf), you need:

The R PACKAGE `roxygen2', make (GNU Make) and Latex (for the pdf).
Then, simply run:

$ make all 

This also installs the package in R.
